<p>[ARDUINO] Digital Dice for fun!</p>
<p>This digital dice was made for play and education. Because it was the first time using Arduino, its completeness is somewhat insufficient.</p>

<p>The picture above is an early design and wanted to give a different charm while imitating the existing design of the dice.</p>

<p>The dice is designed to allow users to set the maximum value at their disposal and to be used for various games.</p>


<h2 id="result"><mark>Result</mark></h2>

<p>As a result, all four of the initially planned functions were implemented.</p>
<p>As I said early, it is designed to allow users to set the maximum value at their disposal and to be used for various games.
The value of the dice is randomly output, and when the set maximum value is output, the LED turns on repeatedly and the sound is
output.That's why users can easily figure out that the maximum value has been reached, and I think this fits well with the games
they usually play at drinking parties.</p>
<p>It can also be used for educational purposes such as basic arduino utilization and learning the right play culture. </p>
