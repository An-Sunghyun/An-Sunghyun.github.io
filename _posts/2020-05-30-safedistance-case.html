<p>[Labview] Safe Distance Smartphone Case</p>
<p>As the penetration rate of smartphones has increased in modern society, many people walk while looking at smartphones.</p>
<p>As such people experience crashes, the traffic accident rate is on the rise.So I made a smartphone case that could detect danger while looking at Smartphone.</p>
<p>Due to poor conditions, it was not implemented as a physical device and was implemented only in software.</p>
<h2 id="Front Panel"><mark>Front Panel</mark></h2>
<p>The database basically has member information and CD key information. Through this, members' personal information, scores, and records will be managed, and Java will link them through certain Java classes.</p>

<p>It implements basic community functions such as genuine registration, login, and membership.</p>

<h2 id="Block Diagram"><mark>Block Diagram</mark></h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/sf-blockdiagram.jpg" alt="blockdiagram img" /></p>
<p>The picture above is block diagram of this program. It has a total of five functions: distance measurement, hazard classification, warning tone output, vibration, and warning statement output.</p>
<strong><mark>Functions</mark></strong>
<ul>
  <li>Distance Measurement</li>
  <li>Hazard Classification</li>
  <li>Warning Tone Output</li>
  <li>Warning Statment Output</li>
  <li>Vibration function</li>
</ul>
<p>Each function has been implemented software-only.</p>

<h2 id="Result"><mark>Result</mark></h2>

<p>Distance measurements were implemented by entering values as if reading sensor values in real time.
So it will make person feel as if a person was walking away and getting closer to obstacles.</p>
<p>Depending on the measured distance values, the hazard is classified into four levels of very dangerous, dangerous, careful and safe.</p>
<p>At the very dangerous stage, warning statements and warning tones are output, and LEDs attached to the case repeatedly illuminate to indicate the danger visually and audibly.</p>
<p>At the dangerous stage, a warning statement is printed with vibration to alert the user of the risk. </p>
