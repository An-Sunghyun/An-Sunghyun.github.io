<p>[JAVA] Chat program using socket communication</p>
<p>It is a chat program based on Java and it is implemented by utilizing all basic Java technology such as linking database, community and so on.</p>
<h2 id="Main frame"><mark>Main Frame</mark></h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/chat-main2.jpg" alt="Main frame img" /></p>
<p>On the main screen, you can chat with other users, and it also provides functions such as changing the color of the background screen and checking current contact list.</p>

<p>This class diagram shows how Java classes within the program are linked.</p>

<h2 id="Database"><mark>Database</mark></h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/chat-database.png" alt="chat database img" /></p>
<p>The database basically has member information. Through this, members' personal information such as name, ID, password will be managed, and Java will link them through certain Java classes..</p>
<p>It implements basic community functions such as genuine registration, login, and membership.</p>

<h2 id="Setting Background Color"><mark>Setting Background Color</mark></h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/chat-background.jpg" alt="background color img" /></p>
<p>On this frame, you can select background via file chooser or just apply random color.</p>
<p>If you choose random color, the color of background will change randomly.</p>

<h2 id="Checking Current Users"><mark>Checking Current Users</mark></h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/chat-currentuser.jpg" alt="current user img" /></p>
<p>On this screen, you can see the list of users currently logged on.</p>
<p>Originally, I wanted to add whispering functions by linking them, but I was not able to implement them due to lack of capability.</p>
