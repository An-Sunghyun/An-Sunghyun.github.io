<p>I used commonly used datasets for the development of sentiment analyzers. The FER-2013 Faces Database. They are approximately 29000 image data, 48x48 size and classified into seven emotions. But One emotion, disgust, has not enough images so I decided to exclude it and train AI. This is because I heard that imbalance in datasets affects accuracy.
However, We go through the pre-process of resizing and arranging data for easy learning. Furthermore, image augmentation (zoom_range = 0.2, horizontal_flip=True, shear_range=0.2) is applied so that arbitrary data can be clearly classified.</p>

<p>I used OpenCV library to recognize faces. I just added a little code to extract the face coordinates.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><mark>Conclusion</mark></h2>
<p>Deep learning models implemented by tensorflow have a canonical graph, but pytorch has not. I think input shape is the main reason why pytorch didn't work properly.
I can set input shape with tensorflow, but pytorch can't. I gathered 48X48 image data and I could set tensorflow's input shape as 48X48. But I couldn't set pytorch's
input shape so I had no choice but to train model with 256x256 size. The data I have is 48X48, but the input shape was 256X256, so I think it cannot have been learned properly.
VGG-16 was the best result with 89% validation acc. However, it is hard to conclude that it is the best because it is a narrow gap with densenet and resnet.</p>
