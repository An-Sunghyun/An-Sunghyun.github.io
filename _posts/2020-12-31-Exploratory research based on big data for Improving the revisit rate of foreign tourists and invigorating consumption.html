<p>[Thesis] Exploratory research based on big data for Improving the revisit rate of foreign tourists and invigorating consumption</p>
<p>Rstudio was used for this thesis</p>
<h2 id="Problem Definition"><mark>Problem Definition</mark></h2>
<p>Satisfaction cannot always be high when foreign tourists eat at a restaurant that Koreans like. This is because there are differences in individual tendencies and cultures. If so, I think it will greatly increase satisfaction and improve convenience if you can guide them to a restaurant that fits their tendencies in public and universally and recognized by Koreans. Therefore, the problem of this study is to be defined as "how to find and utilize the commonalities of restaurants that foreigners and Koreans think of."</p>

<h2 id="Data Set"><mark>Data Set</mark></h2>
<h3 id="Review Tripadvisor">TripAdvisor</h3>

<h3 id="Review Naver">Naver</h3>
<p><img src="assets/images/review_naver.png"  width = "800" alt="Dataset Example" /></p>
<p>In order to analyze the commonalities between the restaurants that foreigners like and the restaurants that Koreans like, it was first necessary to comment on the national site of foreigners who finished sightseeing. To this end, foreign restaurant reviews were collected using a review site called Tripadvisor, and Korean reviews were collected from Naver, the most commonly used search engine in Korea. It is necessary to analyze this data to find information on foods and restaurants that foreigners and Koreans are satisfied with.</p>

<h2 id="Analysis Techniques"><mark>Analysis techniques for deriving information</mark></h2>
<p>In order to find out the preferred food and taste from the previously collected data, important words were extracted through latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) analysis and classified by related topics to derive results. In addition, additional text mining was conducted to find restaurants or food preferred by both Koreans and foreigners, and this was supplemented by the circular graph of visualization and the word cloud. Analysis first collects raw data and purifies it to enable analysis through preprocessing. Thereafter, desired information is calculated through LDA analysis and text mining using the analysis tool(RStudio)</p>

<br/>
<p>According to the LDA topic results, Koreans have a wide variety of types of food they enjoy and use a clear name for the ingredients. Through this, it was also confirmed that the local people knew better about their own food. In addition to the LDA analysis, additional text mining was conducted for Korean and foreign reviews, and visualization was also conducted with word clouds and circular graphs. Visualization data are as follows.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><mark>Conclusion</mark></h2>
<br/>
<p>Through the above analysis, it can be seen that foreigners are also interested in meat, seafood, and traditional foods like Koreans and are highly satisfied. Through this, we propose a restaurant recommendation system that can make sightseeing more enjoyable for foreigners who enjoy sightseeing through the commonalities of restaurants and foods that are well-received by both foreigners and Koreans.</p>
