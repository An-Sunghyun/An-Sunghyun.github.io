<p>This screen is a login screen that allows users to use the program by entering their pre-saved account and password.</p>
<p>Because the database is not used, the administrator must add user information each time.</p>

<h2 id="play frame"><mark>File Chooser Frame</mark></h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/student-management-filechoose.jpg" alt="file chooser img" /></p>
<p>The database was not used, but the ability to read data through a text file is enabled.</p>
<p>Therefore, data can be easily retrieved and used through the file chooser.</p>
