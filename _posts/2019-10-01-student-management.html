<p>[JAVA] Student Management Program</p>
<p>It is a program based on Java and it is implemented by utilizing basic Java technology such as file chooser, login and so on.</p>
<h2 id="Main frame"><mark>Main Frame</mark></h2>

<p>On the main screen, you can select student conditions.</p>
<p>The condition consists of check boxes and a tree, and the results that meet the condition are printed in real time.</p>

<h2 id="checked frame"><mark>When Checked</mark></h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/student-management-checked.jpg" alt="checked frame img" /></p>
<p>As you can see, when you check the check box, only the results that meet the conditions are displayed on the screen.</p>

<h2 id="login frame"><mark>Login Frame</mark></h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/student-management-login.jpg" alt="login frame img" /></p>
<p>This screen is a login screen that allows users to use the program by entering their pre-saved account and password.</p>
<p>Because the database is not used, the administrator must add user information each time.</p>

<h2 id="play frame"><mark>File Chooser Frame</mark></h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/student-management-filechoose.jpg" alt="file chooser img" /></p>
<p>The database was not used, but the ability to read data through a text file is enabled.</p>
<p>Therefore, data can be easily retrieved and used through the file chooser.</p>
