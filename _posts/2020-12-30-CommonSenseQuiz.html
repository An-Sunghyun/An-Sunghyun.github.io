<p><img src="assets/images/quiz-select-mode.png" width = "400" alt="select mode" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>The purpose is to take both learning and fun.</li>
  <li>Common sense and many other problems are required regardless of field (except math problems including religion, science, etc.)</li>
  <li>Used for various purposes, such as playing drinking games or building knowledge</li>
  <li>Requires leveling, stages, difficulty functions, etc. by borrowing systems from existing puzzle games</li>
  <li>Need supplementary means, such as hint items</li>
  <li>All existing games are mixed with too many genres and are not common sense. You can select the genre you want, select intensively, and learn step-by-step from common sense to knowledge and experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Existing App"><mark>Problems with existing apps</mark></h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/quiz-existing.png" width = "400" alt="existing quiz app" /></p>

  <li>Advertisements are constantly pop-up during game play, hurting the game's of the game.</li>
  <li>'common sense' often not a common sense problem</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Differentiation"><mark>Differentiation and Improvement Plan</mark></h2>
<ul>
  <li>It does not mix common sense in a wide variety of fields, but it also addresses field-specific issues to focus on learning knowledge about areas of interest.</li>
  <li>Customized education is provided by dividing the difficulty level without generalization under the name of common sense.</li>
  <li>Handle truly 'common sense' issues unlike previous applications</li>
  <li>Select intuitive and familiar designs with maximum care (User-Friendly)</li>
  <li>Audible/visual effects are provided when certain events occur, such as correct/wrong answers, to facilitate distinguishing.</li>
  <li>Problem description is divided into two parts, a summary and a detailed description, so that the user can choose.</li>
  <li>Have ads pop up during the game and be printed on the screen in a small banner at all times to avoid interfering with the game.</li>
</ul>
